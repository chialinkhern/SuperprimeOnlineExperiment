ad#The decision you need to make is: is the second word a real, physical, object (like a dog or a shoe or a cloud) or is it an abstract idea or concept (like truth or love or beauty)?\n\nSome words (like the examples above) are pretty easy to decide. Others are not as easy. You will just need to make the best choice you can, as quickly as you can.\n\nPress the space bar to continue.

Throughout the experiment, the category you are being asked about will change from time to time.\n\nPress the space bar to continue.
