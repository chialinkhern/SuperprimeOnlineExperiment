Good Job!\n\nI want to take this opportunity to clarify any questions you might have about what you should be doing. Please wait for me to come into the room to check on you.\n\nONLY WHEN INSTRUCTED, press spacebar to continue.
There will be 128 test trials, with breaks in between. The cap on your head will occasionally need attention from me. For that reason, it would be helpful to me if you took your time on breaks (about 60 seconds will do; or longer if you want/need). This gives me time to come in and fix the cap if I need to. 
This part of the experiment usually takes less than 10 minutes.\n\nWe will be keeping track of how many you get correct, and also how quickly you can make the response; so please make your responses as quickly and as accurately as possible.\n\nWhen you are ready, put your fingers on the number pad and press spacebar to begin.
