Good Job!\n\nWe want to take this opportunity to clarify any questions you might have about what you should be doing, but we need to do this as a group. Quietly raise your hand to indicate to the experimenter that you have reached this point. The floor will be open to questions once the experimenter has seen that everybody is done with their practice trials. DO NOT proceed until the experimenter says you can.\n\nONLY WHEN INSTRUCTED, press spacebar to continue.
There will be 128 test trials. The entire experiment usually takes less than 10 minutes.\n\nWe will be keeping track of how many you get correct, and also how quickly you can make the response; so please make your responses as quickly and as accurately as possible.\n\nWhen you are ready, put your fingers on the number pad and press spacebar to begin.
