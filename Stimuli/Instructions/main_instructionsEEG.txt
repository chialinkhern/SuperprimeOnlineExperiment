Hello. Welcome to our experiment.
In this experiment, you will see a series of experimental trials. At the beginning of each trial, you will see a "+" symbol telling you to pay attention, because the trial is about to begin.\n\nEach trial will consist of the following sequence, which you will see on the screen:\n\n  (1) The "+" symbol\n  (2) A word \n  (3) A second word\n\nYour task will be to make a decision (which we will describe soon) about the second word in each sequence.\n\nPress the space bar to continue.
While the words are appearing, please keep your gaze on the center of the screen and minimize blinking. You can blink freely once you respond until the next cross appears.
