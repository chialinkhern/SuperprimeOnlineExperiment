		<b>Key information:</b>  An associate of the Department of Psychology at the University of Illinois is conducting this research. You are being asked to participate in a voluntary research study. The purpose of this study is to investigate the processes that people go through in order to make sense of words, sentences, and everyday objects. As described in more detail below, participating in this study will involve some combination of viewing or listening to everyday stimuli and responding to them. You may be asked comprehension questions about what you've seen or heard, to remember what you saw or heard earlier in the experiment, or to make judgments about how some stimuli fit together. You may also take some tests of knowledge, language, memory, attention, or response speed. Finally, you may be asked to complete questionnaires covering basic health, mental health, and personality characteristics. There are no anticipated risks, beyond those encountered in daily life, associated with participating in this study.
